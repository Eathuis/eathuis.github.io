<h2><span style="font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;">Josh</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:15px;font-weight:bold;color:red;">Eathuis</span></h2></p>
Josh founded PixelCheeseCake in 2012 with the sole intention of making gaming videos with friends, having fun and generally relieving boredom. Since then he has kept the dream alive, with the help of his awesome pals! Josh does mainly Admin work, managing the various PixelCheeseCake accounts around the web, keeping all the information up to date, handling general uploads and maintaining the Staff Team as a whole. He is the self professed <em>de facto</em> Team Leader.</p>
He likes nothing more than watching people take long walks on the beach, from a window in his bedroom to which he never leaves. Favourite games include: Minecraft, Terraria, Crash Bandicoot, Spiral Knights, <em>Any</em> Tower Defense Game, The Sonic Franchise, The Legend of Zelda Franchise and much <em>much</em> more. Most people call him boring!</td></tr>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;">Holly</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:15px;font-weight:bold;color:red;" title="Username">Hollz100</span></h2></p>
Holly is a needed driving force in the PixelCheeseCake team, joining in 2012 she was one of the first Team Members to be welcomed aboard  the sinking life boat entitled "PixelCC" and eventually moving up the ranks to co-owner, owning the website, managing the staff, overseeing video quality and managing YouTube content, aswell as various "behind the scenes" Admin work. She has put alot of personal expense and hard work into PixelCheeseCake and it would not be alive today without her.</p>
Her favourite colour is brown, she has every animal as a pet known to man, she <em>dislikes</em> Josh, is a Gandalf/Morgan Freeman and Kathy Bates Fanatic, preferred console of choice is the PlayStation (PS1 that is), additionally she likes Lucky Charms (the cereal)!</p>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;">Joe</span> <span style="font-size:15px;font-weight:bold;color:red;">MarcyC</span></h2></p>
As a founding member of PixelCheeseCake Joe has had a creative input from day 1, uploading the very first video to the YouTube channel titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaAdI7QjAk" traget="_blank">One off Games: ROBLOX - [Team Swap, Elimination and Base Defense] (Joe Plays)</a>". Joe assisted Josh in writing the fist PixelCC contract on a scrunched up piece of A4 lined paper in 2013, which included soul ownership clauses and complete and utter control of "EVERYTHING". Joe doesn't really assist in the background work, instead focusing his attention on producing content.</p>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;">Izzy</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:15px;font-weight:bold;color:red;">SplodgeKat</span></h2></p>
Izzy (or SplodgeKat) joined the PixelCC crew in early 2014. Taking immediately to video editing she became PixelCheeseCake's very own in house editor, from the off! She has since moved up the ranks to Head Editor, overseeing the internal video production, which includes the audio/visual quality of videos.</p>
She enjoys spending her time reading, sleeping and playing games with friends. Her everyday activities consist of cats, computer games, cheese and surfing the interwebs; she dislikes Spiders, blue cheese, loud sounds and Orcs. she may be a tiny bit obsessed with cats and from time to time revert to speaking in meows, but we just leave her to it.</td>

Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
